I was not an avid reader growing up, but I decided in 2022 that I would no longer take that as an excuse to not be well-read on literature. So I regularly read fiction, mostly the classics, in my free time. Here are some of the texts Iâ€™ve read.

[Albert Camus - _The Stranger_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-stranger-albert-camus/15564796?ean=9780679720201)

[Ralph Ellison - _Invisible Man_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/invisible-man-ralph-ellison/6697209?ean=9780679732761)
