I’m a clinical research assistant in infectious diseases at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/departments/infectious-disease/research), a Harvard-affiliated institution. I've conducted research in transplant infectious diseases and COVID-19 [therapeutics](https://www.wcvb.com/article/boston-researchers-significant-paxlovid-benefit-covid-19-vaccinated-patients/42220461) and [diagnostics](https://testboston.org/). I’m now pursuing a career in medicine and will be matriculating to medical school this fall. My broad interests are in internal medicine and various medical subspecialties. I’m also interested in research and teaching.

I was born in Seoul, South Korea and was raised in various suburbs outside of Toronto, Ontario. Prior to joining the Brigham, I finished my bachelor's degree in physics at [Emory University](https://physics.emory.edu/home/index.html), and worked in business management for a somewhat well-known [retailer](https://corporate.walmart.com/). 

Outside of work, you’ll find me watching sports, playing chess, reading, or hanging out with friends.
