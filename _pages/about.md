I’m a clinical research assistant in infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated institution. At Brigham, I've conducted research in transplant infectious diseases and COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics. 

I was born in Seoul, South Korea and was raised in various suburbs outside of Toronto, Ontario. I finished my bachelor's degree in physics at Emory University, and I’m now pursuing a career in medicine and will be matriculating to medical school this fall. My broad interests are in internal medicine and various medical subspecialties. I’m also interested in research and teaching. 

Outside of school, you’ll find me watching sports, playing chess, reading, or hanging out with friends.
