I’m a first-year medical student, writing about my journey in medical school.

I’m pursuing a career in internal medicine, perhaps in a medical subspecialty. I’m also interested in research and teaching.

Outside of school, you’ll find me watching sports, playing chess, reading, or just hanging out with friends.
