In my free time, I enjoy playing chess semi-competitively. I’m of Class A strength (Elo 1800-2000). I really like how chess allows me, for at least a moment, to completely forget about stressors at work and in life. Chess has also moulded me into an individual who is more comfortable with embracing obstacles and failure.

Below, enjoy both some of the coolest and some of the most embarrassing games I’ve ever played, with all of their scathing commentary. I am the bottom color in each of the following boards.

This is the first game that I ever played in an official tournament. I was living in San Francisco at the time, and attended a tournament at the world-renowned, historical [Mechanics' Institute Chess Club](https://www.milibrary.org/chess). Although I had just turned 22 years old at the time, I was still much more inexperienced and nervous than my teenage opponent. My quality of play here is substantially lower than that shown in later games.

The following game is without a doubt the most crushing, memorable defeat that I have ever suffered. This may sound odd, given that my opponent was rated higher than me, making me the slight underdog. However, it was the manner at which I was handed defeat that felt most painful.

At the time, I entered the game having just scored a miraculous upset in the previous round, with a draw against a National Master. The confidence I had built up came crashing down after this game.

Fast forward a two years later, I had already been living in Boston for some time. The pandemic had begun about a year ago, and the [Boylston Chess Club](https://boylstonchess.org/) in Boston had just re-opened for small tournaments with strict masking rules in place. I had recently crossed into the Class A territory, Elo 1800. The first in-person game I played in over a year was a nice one.

The last game is one of my highest-rated victories to date, played in mid-2021. I played a very nice game to defeat an Expert-level player (Elo 2000-2200). She was the reigning Massachusetts Girls Champion at the time. Today, she is a National Master. Safe to say, I capitalized on what may have been my one chance to defeat her (we played again recently, and I lost).
