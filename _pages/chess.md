I’m a class-A chess player (Elo 1800-2000). I try to find spare time here and there for a long, classical game. I really like how chess allows me to escape from stressors in life, and it has made me into an individual who is much better at embracing obstacles and failure.

Enjoy some of the coolest and most embarrassing games I’ve ever played, with all their scathing commentary.
