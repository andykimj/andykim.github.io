In my free time, I enjoy playing chess semi-competitively. I’m a Class A player (Elo 1800-2000). I really like how chess allows me, for at least a moment while I play, to completely forget about any stressors at work and in life. Chess has also moulded me into an individual who is more comfortable with embracing obstacles and failure.

Below, enjoy both some of the coolest and some of the most embarrassing games that I’ve ever played, with all of their scathing commentary. I am the bottom color in each of the following boards.

This is the first game that I ever played in an official tournament. I was living in San Francisco at the time, and entered a weekend tournament at the world-renowned, historical [Mechanics' Institute Chess Club](https://www.milibrary.org/chess). I had recently turned 22 years old, but I was still much more inexperienced and nervous than my teenage opponent. My quality of play here is substantially lower than that shown in later games.

The following game is definitely the most crushing defeat that I have ever suffered. This may sound odd, given that my opponent was rated higher than me, making me the slight underdog. However, it was the manner at which I lost that makes this game one that I will never forget.

At the time, I entered the game having just scored a miraculous upset in the previous round, with a draw against a National Master (Elo 2200+). The confidence that I had built up was destroyed after this game. I still think sometimes about how painful it was.

Fast forward two years later: I have been living in Boston for some time. The pandemic began about a year ago, and the [Boylston Chess Club](https://boylstonchess.org/) has just re-opened for small tournaments with strict masking rules in place. I enter the tournament having just crossed Elo 1800. The first in-person game I play in over a year would turn out to be a nice one.

This last game is one of my highest-rated victories to date, played in summer of 2021. I played a very nice game to defeat an Expert-level player (Elo 2000-2200). She was the reigning Massachusetts Girls Champion at the time. Today, she is a National Master. Safe to say, I capitalized on what may have been my one chance to defeat her (we played again recently, and I lost).
